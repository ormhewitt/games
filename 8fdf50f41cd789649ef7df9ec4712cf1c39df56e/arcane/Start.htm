    <p style="color:red;">Apologies for the barren nature of this page, I will make something nicer later. Here is the reconstructed version of Arcane Online Mystery Serial, now playable in (more or less) its original format. Save games are intact and the menu links have been corrected to point to the new locations of episodes and cinematics, and the soundtrack has been fully restored with high quality MP3 tracks. A few things to note, however:</p>
    <ol>
       <li style="color:red;"> For some users, issues will occur with the S1 music the first time you enable Flash on this site. Exiting to this page and then reloading the game after allowing Flash should fix it. </li>
       <li style="color:red;"> Best to avoid usage of back/forward arrows and reloads, odd things happen with how the game's framing page was originally programmed if you do. </li>
        <li style="color:red;"> While episode links and internal menu sections work fine, other external links on the menus such as Message Boards are still broken; I have not done anything about this yet. </li>
        <li style="color:red;"> This is currently only tested in Chrome- Edge, at the least, has compatability issues with S1 and may try opening the music in new tabs instead of inside the game frame. </li>
    </ol>
<p style="color:red;">
Otherwise, everything should be good to go. Cookies must be enabled to save/load. Have fun!

<p style="color:red;">Important Note: I DO NOT OWN THIS GAME. All game files and assets and accompanying web code were originally created by Sarbakan, The Threshold Entertainment, and Warner Bros, and recovered from the Wayback Machine. I have made only minor edits for compatability with modern computers and written some new scripts to fix broken saves in season 2 episodes. Arcane and all associated things are owned entirely by Warner Bros.</p>
